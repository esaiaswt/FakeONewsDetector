# Fake-o-News Detector

This is based on AWS excellent blog [Harness large language models in fake news detection](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/harness-large-language-models-in-fake-news-detection/).

I have modified to Google's Gemini to enourage more coders out there to look into this area of using the power of technology to do good: by getting rid the bad and the ugly "fake news".  I do encourage all to try AWS's Bedrock and other LLMs to make this area of fake news detection an daily successful applications of Generative AI.

The AWS blog do give this project a good start into [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) with LLM.

Note: 
* Chain-Of-Thought prompt may give flase positives while ReAct is more accurate.
* Therefore, this the still experimental.  Hence, encourage all to try all Gen AI models and come out the best detector.
* Code is run using [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
